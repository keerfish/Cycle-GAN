# Image Translation of Fotos and Paintings using CycleGAN
This toy example of CycleGAN is a simplified implementation of the well-known [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN). 

**Note**: For a detailed explanation of the principles and implementation, please refer to the original paper and resources provided by the authors: <br />
