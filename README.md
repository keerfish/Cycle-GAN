# Image Translation of Fotos and Paintings using CycleGAN
This toy example of CycleGAN is a simplified implementation of the well-known [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN).

**Note**: For a detailed explanation of the principles and implementation, please refer to the original paper and resources provided by the authors: <br />

## Architecture
The original paper, [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8237506) presents desired applications such as photo-to-painting translation, style and season transfer, object transfiguration, and photo enhancement. The example here only implemented image translation between photos and paintings. The architecture is illustrated as follows:
